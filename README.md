## HAR
- Neural network heterogeneous autoregressive models for realized volatility, Jaiyool Kim, Changryong Baek
  - HAR-NN, HAR(infinite)-NN, HAR-AR(22)-NN
  - HAR-NN is better than traditional HAR, can capture sharper changes due to higher volatility

- Forecasting realized volatility: HAR against Principal Components Combining, neural networks and GARCH
  - HAR is better thatn NN+GARCH

- Realized Volatility Forecasting with Neural Networks
  - recurrent neural networks are able to outperform all the traditional econometric methods
